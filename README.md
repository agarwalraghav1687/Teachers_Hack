# Teachers_Hack
Let's thank our teachers for all they have done for us :)

## Inspiration
Teachers are the ones who nurtured us and showed the right path in our life. Teachers are certainly next to our parents and without them, we wouldn't have been what we are or have achieved today. They shape the student’s careers and pave the way for their success. Bill Gates also said, "Technology is just a tool. In terms of getting the kids working together and motivating them, the teacher is the most important.”
You can read and learn from any book, but the knowledge shared by the teacher is what remains with you forever. 

Even during this time of the pandemic, everything had gone virtual including the studies. Most of them not had access to laptops and even most of the teacher’s didn’t know how to use a laptop. But they didn’t give up. They tried their best to teach the students, some of them used their mobile phone’s camera and holding it while writing, some created a mobile phone stand and much more. People might think it is an easy task to teach online, but only the teacher knows how difficult it is to manage things. For a person who has never used a laptop in life to teaching the students using it, they have gone through a lot.

So, on this Teacher's Day, I decided to bring a smile to the teacher’s face and celebrate the efforts that our teachers have made to make us what we are, and teaching us even in these harsh times and for never giving up. To do that, I have created a filter that will require a person to smile to activate the filter. The filter is a small gesture of love from my side to celebrate the work all teachers have done for making us better people in life.
## What it does
When you open this filter, it will ask you to smile to activate the filter and as soon as you smile, you will see a heart flying in the sky and then it will burst and then you can see the confetti falling from the sky and then a message “Thank You Teacher” over your head and nice decoration and sunglasses on your face. After that, you will hear a yay sound and the next message “Happy Teachers Day” and will see the balloons coming up from the bottom and you will have a nice scene ready. 
It is done to make the teacher’s feel special and to celebrate all the efforts that they have made so that our studies and future is not compromised. 
Thank you teacher’s for what you have done for us. 

## How we built it
I built it using SparkAR Studio and Patch Editor. I took the help of the SparkAR library to download the models of balloons and heart. I created the confetti effect using patch editor and particle system and used point light so that I can get a good reflection on the confetti. I also used AdobeXd to create the top decoration of the filter.

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge that I faced was to time everything and to make everything sequentially so that it feels good to the user. And another one was to make the previous text disappear when the next text is displayed. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The biggest accomplishment that I am proud of is, I was able to create this filter which I was thinking of for a long time and I was able to create this filter during this hackathon in few hours and also get it published on Instagram and Facebook.

## What we learned
I learnt how to make the text disappear before the next text is appeared and to make things works sequentially so that it feels good to the user and they enjoy it.
